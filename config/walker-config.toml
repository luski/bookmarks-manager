# Walker Configuration for Bookmarks Manager
# This shows what the initialization script adds to your Walker config
# The script will only add these minimal changes to your existing config

# Adds bookmarks to your default providers array
# (Only adds "menus:bookmarks" to your existing default array)
[providers]
default = [
  "menus:bookmarks",  # This line gets added to your existing providers
]

# Adds a prefix for exclusive bookmark search
# (This entire section gets appended if not already present)
[[providers.prefixes]]
prefix = "!"
provider = "menus:bookmarks"

# Note: The initialization script is smart enough to:
# - Detect your existing Walker configuration
# - Only add what's needed for bookmarks
# - Preserve all your other settings
# - Create a backup before making changes
